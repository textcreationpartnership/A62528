            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THree Months since and more, having (on such grounds as all that know the state of <hi>Abingdon</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but approve) taken up resolutions to remove from <hi>Abingdon,</hi> I declared both Privately and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely what I intended, giving them three Months time to provide themselves another Minister: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I removed from my house, and put my selfe only into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing posture, till the three Months should exspire, or another Minister within that time should come to succeed me: upon this, though some said little, yet others (to whom my heart did cleave) came to me, expressing their most earnest desires of my staying with them: and the truth is, upon their desires, with the names of such who had been (as they said) converted by my Ministrie amongst them, and the Consideration of the danger wherein I was like to leave them, my heart began to work againe towards some farther tryall with them; no sooner was this known, but suddainly such a storme fell upon mee, and such usage did I meet withall from some of them (which I am loath to publish) that my affections and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Severall meetings there were spent about (if not against) me, at the last of them I was sadly present, but in the close of it, such whose hearts did seeme to cleave to mee, renewed their earnest desires for my farther tryall of them. I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know on what termes I should continue? what rules they would observe? whether they would propose any to mee, or it were their desire I should propose to them? They all desired that I would stay on my own termes, and that they would walk by such rules as I should judge to bee according to the Word, and propose to them; there was not one dissented, although I then expressed, that I would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51394:3"/>bring them to the Administration of the Sacraments in publicke, they all seemed greatly to rejoyce in the hopes of my continuance with them: I left it with them under my hand in writing, that I would propose my Rules to them, and that if they should approve of them, I would in due time give them a satisfactory answer. The Rules were at the next meeting proposed, and are these that follow.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2 That all such as shall seriously and solemnely professe their Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ, be received; (provided that they be endowed with a competent measure of knowledge in the things of God, and are of an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved conversation, or shall seriously and solemnely professe (to the rationall satisfaction of the Church) their Repentance of those particular Scandals wherewith they may be charged, engaging by Covenant and promise (in the strength of God to walke with him and his People in all his Waies and Ordinances for the future.) And that, although we are not sure that they have much more in them of the truth of Grace, for the Present, then this Profession.</p>

                  <hi>Quaerie,</hi> whether we are not bound in Conscience with Charity, to believe (or hope at least) that there is the truth of Grace, where there is such profession made, till we have demonstrations to the contrary.

The hypocrisy of some, &amp; the tolleration of some open scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sinners in the Church, doth not forthwith take away the nature of the Church. Notwithstanding the discovery of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and tolleration of some open scandalls, yet separation is not forthwith to be made from the Church.
